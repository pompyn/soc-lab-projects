# 🌐 Cloud Support & Security Operations Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio — a collection of hands-on technical projects completed through the **NextWork platform**, focused on **Cloud Support**, **Security Operations**, and **infrastructure monitoring**.

Each project reflects real-world tasks, combining tools and platforms such as **AWS**, **Azure**, **Linux**, **SIEM tools**, and **infrastructure as code**. These projects demonstrate not just technical skills, but my commitment to continuous learning and practical application in the cloud and cybersecurity domains.
