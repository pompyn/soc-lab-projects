# 🌐 Cloud & Security Operations Portfolio

Welcome to my technical portfolio — a curated collection of hands-on projects in **Cloud Support**, **Security Operations**, and **infrastructure monitoring and automation**.

This repository is divided into two categories:

- **Academic Projects**: Guided learning challenges, certification labs, and structured exercises (e.g., from NextWork and training platforms)
- **Professional Projects**: Self-directed work, homelab deployments, applied cybersecurity and cloud configurations, and automation workflows

Each project reflects my growth in cloud infrastructure, security engineering, and system resilience — and is documented for clarity and reproducibility.

## 📚 Academic Projects

[➡️ View Academic Projects Folder](./academic-projects/)

These projects were completed as part of structured learning paths and include:

- The NextWork 5-Day Beginner Challenge
- Certification-aligned exercises (AWS, Azure, CompTIA)
- Simulated SOC analyst workflows
- IAM policy design and monitoring setups

> ⚠️ Disclaimer: Some academic projects may follow learning prompts provided by third-party platforms. All work shown reflects my independent understanding and execution.

## 💼 Professional Projects

[➡️ View Professional Projects Folder](./professional-projects/)

These are independently created or customized projects focused on:
- Practical infrastructure deployments
- Incident response simulations
- Custom IAM and policy frameworks
- Cloud-native monitoring stacks (e.g., Wazuh, ELK, Prometheus)

Projects in this section represent real-world troubleshooting, experimentation, and system design.
